Ancient Egyptian Sculpture

To comprehend ancient Egyptian art, it is crucial to have a comprehensive understanding of the worldview of the elite Egyptians, as well as the purposes and contexts of the art created for them.

Without this knowledge, we can only appreciate the formal content of Egyptian art, and we will fail to grasp the reasons behind its production or the concepts that influenced its distinctive forms.

In fact, a lack of understanding regarding the purposes of Egyptian art has often led to unfavorable comparisons with the art of other cultures.

Why didn't the Egyptians develop sculptures in which the body turned and twisted through space like classical Greek statuary?

Why do the artists seem to confuse left and right?

And why didn't they discover geometric perspective like European artists did during the Renaissance?

The answers to these questions have nothing to do with a lack of skill or imagination on the part of Egyptian artists, but everything to do with the purposes for which they created their art.

The majority of three-dimensional representations, whether standing, seated, or kneeling, exhibit what is known as frontality: they face straight ahead, without twisting or turning.

When these statues are viewed in isolation, without knowledge of their original context and function, it is easy to criticize them for their rigid postures that remained unchanged for three thousand years.

However, frontality is directly related to the functions of Egyptian statuary and the contexts in which the statues were placed.

The statues were not created for decorative purposes, but rather to play a primary role in the worship of gods, the king, and the deceased.

They were designed to be placed in locations where these beings could manifest themselves and be the recipients of ritual actions.

Therefore, it made sense to depict the statue looking ahead, towards what was happening in front of it, so that the living performer of the ritual could interact with the divine or deceased recipient.

Often, these statues were enclosed in rectangular shrines or wall niches with only an opening at the front, making frontality a natural choice.

Other statues were intended to be placed within architectural settings, such as in front of monumental entrance gateways to temples known as pylons, or in pillared courts, where they would be positioned against or between pillars.

In these cases, frontality harmonized perfectly with the architectural context.

Statues were typically made of stone, wood, or metal.

Stone statues were carved from single rectangular blocks of material and retained the original shape's compactness.

The stone between the arms and the body, or between the legs in standing figures, or between the legs and the seat in seated figures, was usually left intact.

From a practical standpoint, this protected the figures from breakage and psychologically conveyed a sense of strength and power, often enhanced by a supporting back pillar.

In contrast, wooden statues were carved from multiple pieces of wood that were joined together with pegs to form the final work, while metal statues were either made by wrapping sheet metal around a wooden core or cast using the lost wax process.

The arms could be held away from the body and carry separate items in their hands, and there was no back pillar.

The overall effect was lighter and more fluid compared to stone statues, but because both types served the same function, formal wooden and metal statues still exhibited frontality.

Apart from statues representing deities, kings, and named members of the elite, which can be considered formal, there is another group of three-dimensional representations that depict generic figures, often servants, from the non-elite population.

The function of these figures is quite different.

Many of them were created to be placed in the tombs of the elite, serving the tomb owners in the afterlife.

Unlike formal statues, which are limited to static poses of standing, sitting, and kneeling, these figures depict a wide range of actions, such as grinding grain, baking bread, producing pots, and making music.

They are shown in appropriate poses, bending and squatting as they carry out their tasks.
