Latitude and Biodiversity

When we examine the distribution of biodiversity (biological diversity) across the Earth's land surface, we discover that it is far from uniform.

The tropics exhibit a significantly higher overall species count compared to an equivalent area at higher latitudes.

This pattern seems to hold true for various animal and plant groups.

Why do higher latitudes exhibit lower biodiversity compared to the tropics?

It could be attributed to land area.

The tropics encompass a larger land surface area than higher latitudes.

This fact is not always apparent when we analyze commonly used projections of Earth's curved surface, as they tend to exaggerate the land areas in higher latitudes.

Some biogeographers consider this difference in diversity as a reflection of the effect of land area.

However, biologist Klaus Rohde's analysis of the data does not support this explanation.

While land area may contribute to biodiversity, it is certainly not the sole factor.

Otherwise, large landmasses would consistently harbor more species.

Instead, productivity appears to play a role, albeit indirectly.

Regions with optimal conditions for plant growth, characterized by relatively high and uniform temperatures and abundant water supply, tend to support extensive vegetation.

This results in a complex layering of plant material.

For instance, in a tropical rainforest, a substantial amount of plant material accumulates above the ground surface.

There is also a significant mass of root tissues below ground, although it may be less conspicuous.

Detailed analysis of the above-ground material reveals a series of layers, with the exact number varying depending on forest age and nature.

The arrangement of the vegetation's biological mass, known as "biomass," into layered forms is referred to as its "structure" (distinct from its "composition," which pertains to the species forming the community).

Structure essentially represents the architecture of vegetation, and in the case of tropical forests, it can be highly intricate.

In a mature floodplain tropical forest in the Amazon River basin, the canopy (the uppermost layers formed by tree crowns) exhibits a stratified structure.

Leaf cover peaks at approximately 3, 6, and 30 meters above the ground, with the tallest trees standing free of the main canopy at 50 meters, forming their own open layer.

Thus, such a forest typically comprises four canopy layers.

In contrast, temperate forests often have only two canopy layers, resulting in a less complex architecture.

Structure exerts a significant influence on the animal life inhabiting a particular site.

It shapes the spatial environment in which animals feed, move, seek shelter, live, and reproduce.

It even impacts the local climate (referred to as the "microclimate") by influencing light intensity, humidity, and temperature range and extremes.

For instance, a grassland area with a simple vegetation structure experiences a distinct microclimate at ground level compared to the upper canopy.

Wind speeds are lower, daytime temperatures are lower (but warmer at night), and relative humidity is higher near the ground.

The complexity of the microclimate is closely linked to the complexity of vegetation structure.

Generally, the more intricate the vegetation structure, the greater the number of animal species capable of thriving in that environment.

The high plant biomass in the tropics contributes to greater spatial complexity, thereby providing a higher potential for diversity in the organisms that can inhabit a region.

Conversely, the climates of higher latitudes are generally less conducive to accumulating large quantities of biomass.

Consequently, vegetation structure is simpler, resulting in lower animal diversity.
