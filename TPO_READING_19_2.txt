Succession, Climax, and Ecosystems

In the late 19th century, ecology began to emerge as an independent science, branching out from its origins in natural history and plant geography.

The focus of this new field, known as "community ecology," was on the composition and structure of communities consisting of different species.

In the early 20th century, American ecologist Frederic Clements observed that a succession of plant communities would develop following a disturbance such as a volcanic eruption, heavy flood, or forest fire.

For example, an abandoned field would be progressively colonized by herbaceous plants (plants with little or no woody tissue), shrubs, and trees, eventually transforming into a forest.

Light-loving species typically appear as the initial invaders, while shade-tolerant species emerge later in the succession.

Clements and other early ecologists perceived a certain regularity in the order of succession, although this has not been fully substantiated.

While a general trend can be identified, the specific details are often unpredictable.

Succession is influenced by numerous factors, including soil characteristics, sun and wind exposure, precipitation patterns, chance colonizations, and other random processes.

The final stage of succession, referred to as the climax by Clements and his contemporaries, is also unpredictable and lacks uniform composition.

Even in a mature community, there is typically a significant turnover in species composition.

The nature of the climax is influenced by the same factors that affect succession.

Nonetheless, mature natural environments generally reach a state of equilibrium and undergo relatively little change over time unless the environment itself undergoes alterations.

Clements regarded the climax as a "superorganism," an organic entity.

However, some authors who embraced the concept of climax rejected Clements' characterization, considering it a misleading metaphor.

An ant colony can be legitimately described as a superorganism due to its highly organized communication system, which enables the colony to function as a cohesive unit in response to circumstances.

In contrast, there is no evidence of such an interacting communicative network within a climax plant formation.

Many authors prefer the term "association" over "community" to emphasize the loose nature of the interactions.

Even more problematic was the extension of this thinking to include animals alongside plants, resulting in the concept of a "biome" as a combination of coexisting flora and fauna.

While it is true that many animals are closely associated with specific plants, it is misleading to speak of a "spruce-moose biome," for instance, as there is no internal cohesion to their association akin to that of an organism.

The presence or absence of moose does not substantially affect the spruce community.

In fact, vast areas of spruce forest exist without moose.

The opposition to Clements' concept of plant ecology was initiated by Herbert Gleason, who was soon joined by other ecologists.

Their main argument was that the distribution of a given species is controlled by its habitat requirements, and thus, vegetation types are a simple consequence of the ecologies of individual plant species.

As criticisms mounted against terms like "climax," "biome," and "superorganism" in relation to the association of animals and plants in a specific locality, the term "ecosystem" gained increasing popularity to describe the entire system of interconnected organisms and their physical environment.

Eventually, the focus shifted to the role of ecosystems in energy transformation.

Ecosystems involve the circulation, transformation, and accumulation of energy and matter through the activities of living organisms.

Ecologists are primarily concerned with the quantities of matter and energy that flow through a given ecosystem and the rates at which they do so.

While the ecosystem concept enjoyed great popularity in the 1950s and 1960s, it is no longer the dominant paradigm.

Gleason's arguments against climax and biome also apply to ecosystems.

Furthermore, the sheer number of interactions within ecosystems makes them challenging to analyze, even with the aid of powerful computers.

Additionally, younger ecologists have found ecological problems related to behavior and life-history adaptations more appealing than measuring physical constants.

Nevertheless, the term "ecosystem" is still used to refer to a local association of animals and plants, often without significant attention to the energy aspects.
