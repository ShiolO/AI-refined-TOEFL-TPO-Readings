Termite Ingenuity

Termites, social insects that live in colonies containing 2 million individuals or more in some species, are often mistakenly referred to as white ants.

However, they are not ants.

Termites, unlike ants, undergo gradual metamorphosis with only three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult.

Ants and other social members of their order, such as certain bees and wasps, undergo complete metamorphosis in four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult.

The worker and soldier castes of social ants, bees, and wasps consist solely of females, all of whom are daughters of a single queen that mated soon after maturing and never mated again.

In contrast, the worker and soldier castes of termites consist of both males and females, and the queen permanently resides with a male consort.

Due to their small and soft-bodied nature, termites are prone to desiccation and therefore require moist environments with high relative humidity.

They thrive when the relative humidity in their nests is above 96 percent, and the temperature is relatively high, around 79℉ for temperate zone species and 86℉ for tropical species.

Subterranean termites, the destructive species commonly found throughout the eastern United States, achieve these conditions by nesting in moist soil that is in contact with wood, their sole source of food.

The surrounding soil maintains the nest's moisture and helps regulate the temperature.

During winter, when it is cold, subterranean termites move to burrows below the frost line.

Some tropical termites exhibit remarkable engineering skills by constructing large above-ground nests with built-in "air conditioning" systems that maintain constant temperature, moisture, and oxygen supply.

One of the most architecturally advanced termite species is Macrotermes natalensis, found in Africa.

Swiss entomologist Martin Luscher described the mounds built by this fungus-growing species as reaching heights of up to 16 feet, with a base diameter of 16 feet and a wall thickness of 16 to 23 inches, composed of soil mixed with termite saliva.

The thick and dense mound wall insulates the interior microclimate from external humidity and temperature fluctuations.

Several narrow ridges with relatively thin walls extend from the base to the top of the mound.

According to Luscher, a medium-sized Macrotermes nest houses approximately 2 million individuals.

The metabolism of these termites and the fungus they cultivate as food contribute to maintaining a warm interior and provide some moisture to the nest's air.

The termites saturate the nest's atmosphere, reaching about 100 percent relative humidity, by carrying water from the soil.

However, how is this well-insulated nest ventilated?

The numerous occupants require over 250 quarts of oxygen (equivalent to more than 1,200 quarts of air) per day.

How can such a large amount of oxygen diffuse through the thick mound walls?

Even the wall pores are filled with water, which hinders gas diffusion.

The answer lies in the nest's construction.

The interior consists of a large central core where the fungus is cultivated.

Below the core is an empty "cellar," and above it is an empty "attic."

The ridges on the outer wall of the nest contain numerous small tunnels that connect the cellar and the attic.

The warm air in the fungus gardens rises through the nest to the attic.

From there, the air passes into the tunnels within the ridges and flows back down to the cellar.

Gases, primarily oxygen entering and carbon dioxide exiting, easily diffuse into or out of the ridges due to their thin walls and large surface area, as they protrude significantly from the mound's wall.

Consequently, the air flowing down into the cellar through the ridges is relatively rich in oxygen and depleted of carbon dioxide.

As it rises through the fungus-growing area back up to the attic, it supplies the nest's inhabitants with fresh oxygen.
