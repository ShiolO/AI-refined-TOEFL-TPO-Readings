Writing History

Historians throughout the ages have faced numerous challenges in their attempts to write history.

Modern historians writing the history of Africa encounter similar problems to their colleagues writing the history of other cultures.

Most medieval African societies south of the Sahara did not have an alphabet or a written language.

African written languages were mainly limited to Ethiopia, Sudan, and the maritime cities of the east coast.

Early Greek, Roman, Amharic, Fulani, and Swahili texts still exist, providing some insight into the past.

Future collectors will likely discover additional records when searching for documents in North Africa and distant countries like Iran and Saudi Arabia.

However, in tropical countries, preserving old papers is extremely difficult due to white ants and atmospheric humidity, which pose serious challenges even for modern archivists.

Early record keepers were even less capable, resulting in the loss or destruction of much material.

The absence of written material means that we will never be able to read, for example, the memoirs of an eighteenth-century king of the Luba people.

Even worse, we cannot rely on administrative archives.

Despite their dull appearance, administrative files possess a unique value that other written records lack.

They consist of documents created or used in the course of administrative or executive transactions.

This does not necessarily make official memorandums, communiques, and similar documents more reliable, as officials often acted dishonestly towards both their subordinates and superiors.

However, unlike many biographers, they rarely wrote with the intention of deceiving future generations.

Therefore, archival evidence possesses an unusual level of authenticity.

The absence of such material makes the historian's task exceedingly difficult.

Without writing, there are significant aspects of human behavior that can only be accurately described through speculative extrapolations from literate cultures or conjectures influenced by our own cultural preconceptions.

Consequently, some historians attempt to supplement their sources with information from indigenous traditions, folklore, heroic legends, genealogical tables, and personal reminiscences.

However, utilizing oral history presents its own set of challenges.

Historians can revisit the same document repeatedly, as can their successors.

An artifact can be preserved in a museum, allowing different conclusions to be drawn by reevaluating the same evidence.

But two or three people cannot interview the same informant twice, and even if they could, they would not necessarily obtain the same information.

The interviewers themselves contribute to subjectivity in the information they gather.

Furthermore, human witnesses retain memories of previous interviews, and their recollections cannot be erased like a magnetic tape.

Consequently, questioning them repeatedly will inevitably result in some degree of change in their answers.

Admittedly, it is easy to underestimate the value of information obtained by oral historians investigating preliterate societies.

Professional poets and singers may faithfully transmit the same lay or genealogical table for many generations, as their memory is unquestionable.

Nevertheless, oral tradition is always subject to change.

For example, the Lunda people living along the Luapula River are deeply interested in their own past.

However, as observed by lan Cunnison, a British anthropologist, "this is not history as we know it.

It is the transmission of what is already known or believed, and it does not involve questioning the past and searching for answers."

This does not imply that oral traditions hold no value for historians.

They stimulate imagination, inspire new questions, and provide significant insights into a people's culture.

They also offer a foundation of factual information.

However, they are challenging to interpret, and conventional intellectual tools employed by historians may often prove inadequate for the task.

Furthermore, oral traditions, like all other forms of evidence, require corroboration and cannot be accepted solely based on their own authority.
