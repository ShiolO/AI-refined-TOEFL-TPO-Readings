The Revolution of Cheap Print

The first half of the nineteenth century witnessed significant changes in the economics of the printed word in both the United States and Europe, although these changes generally occurred earlier and on a larger scale in America.

In the 1830s and 1840s, there were significant reductions in prices for newspapers and books in America, marking the beginning of an era of affordable print.

Daily newspapers, which previously sold for 6 cents per copy, were now available for a penny or two.

Novels, which used to cost $2, were now sold for 25 cents or even less, while the same books in Britain were priced at over $7.

The rapid decline in print prices during such a short period can be considered an information-price revolution, one of many episodes of declining prices that have had a profound impact on information and culture over the past two centuries.

Two cultural innovations in mid-nineteenth-century America, known as the "penny press" and the "dime novel," were named after their low prices.

These publications were criticized for being cheap in both senses of the word: inexpensive and lacking in taste.

However, low price did not necessarily equate to low quality.

Book publishers increasingly released even the most esteemed works in affordable editions to reach a wider audience.

The information-price revolution also influenced religious and political publishing, as reading became a means of mass persuasion for the first time in history.

The rise of cheap print was not entirely unprecedented.

In seventeenth- and eighteenth-century England and France, inexpensive collections of stories, ballads, and other miscellaneous works circulated among the lower classes.

However, since only a minority of the poor were able to read, most people listened to these works being read aloud.

Therefore, cheap print reached more of a listening public than a reading one.

The expansion of cheap print in the nineteenth century in America and Europe occurred on a much larger scale and coincided with a significant increase in literacy rates.

Together, these developments marked a cultural turning point.

Traditionally, even in literate households, books and other publications were relatively rare and cherished possessions.

Reading primarily involved returning to a few texts, particularly religious works.

However, with the proliferation of print, reading became more diverse, and readers began to skim through newspapers, magazines, and cheap books that they would soon pass on or discard.

While intensive reading of religious and other works did not disappear, reading became an increasingly common form of both entertainment and devotion.

The conventional explanation for the rise of cheap print emphasizes technological advancements.

Undoubtedly, the full development of affordable print would not have been possible without technological changes.

However, print had already become cheaper in America before technological advances played a significant role.

New technology emerged once the process was already underway, rather than being the initial catalyst.

This was not a coincidence: the continuous expansion of print created an incentive for technological innovation.

To view technology as the sole driving force understates the prior importance of politics, culture, and markets in creating the conditions that allowed investments in new technology to be successful.

In America, cheap print was a result of public policy.

While European governments imposed taxes on newspapers and other publications, the United States exempted them from taxes and even provided subsidies through the postal system.

The rise of affordable books and other forms of print in the United States also reflected distinct patterns in nineteenth-century American consumer markets.

As noted by economic historian Nathan Rosenberg, citing examples such as cutlery, guns, boots, and clothing, "Americans readily accepted products deliberately designed for low cost and mass production methods" at a time when handmade goods still prevailed in Britain.

Books followed this pattern.

Americans were not primarily responsible for introducing new manufacturing technology to book production.

On the contrary, most of the key advancements in printing and papermaking before 1850 had originated in Europe and crossed the Atlantic.

However, the industrialization of book production progressed more rapidly in the United States, where the market in the mid-nineteenth century was not only larger than in Britain but also appeared to prioritize price over quality, possibly because elite readers constituted a smaller proportion of book buyers.
