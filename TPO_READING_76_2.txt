Extinction of the Dinosaurs

The Paleozoic Era occurred from 334 to 248 million years ago, followed by the Mesozoic Era from 245 to 65 million years ago, which consisted of the Triassic Period, Jurassic Period, and Cretaceous Period.

The Cenozoic Era began 65 million years ago and continues to the present.

Paleontologists have long debated the cause of the dinosaurs' extinction, suggesting that it was due to climatic changes resulting from the shifting positions of continents and seas caused by plate tectonics.

Throughout the Cretaceous period, which was the last period of the Mesozoic era when dinosaurs thrived, large shallow seas periodically covered extensive areas of the continents.

Various sources of data, including geochemical evidence preserved in seafloor sediments, indicate that the Late Cretaceous climate was milder than the present climate.

The temperatures were moderate, with neither excessively hot days nor extremely cold nights.

Summers were warm but not scorching, and winters were chilly but not freezing.

The shallow seas likely helped stabilize the nearby air temperature, keeping it relatively constant.

Towards the end of the Cretaceous, the geological record shows that these seaways receded from the continents and returned to the major ocean basins.

The reason for this retreat remains unknown.

However, over a span of approximately 100,000 years, as the seas withdrew, global climates became significantly more extreme, with hotter days, cooler nights, and more pronounced seasonal variations.

It is possible that dinosaurs could not adapt to these drastic temperature changes and eventually became extinct.

However, if this hypothesis is true, why did cold-blooded animals such as snakes, lizards, turtles, and crocodiles survive the freezing winters and scorching summers?

These animals rely on the environment to maintain their body temperature.

It is difficult to comprehend why they would remain unaffected while dinosaurs, potentially warm-blooded creatures, were unable to cope.

Critics also argue that the shallow seaways had advanced and retreated from the continents multiple times during the Mesozoic era.

If the earlier fluctuations did not cause the extinction of dinosaurs, why did the climatic changes associated with the final retreat of the seaways lead to their demise?

Although the idea of a simple climatic change related to sea levels initially seems plausible, it fails to explain all the available data.

Dissatisfaction with conventional explanations for dinosaur extinctions has led to a surprising observation, which in turn has given rise to a new hypothesis.

Many plant and animal species abruptly disappear from the fossil record as one moves from layers of rock representing the end of the Cretaceous to rocks representing the beginning of the Cenozoic era.

Often, there is a thin layer of clay between the last Cretaceous rock layer and the first Cenozoic rock layer.

Scientists believed that they could estimate the duration of the extinctions by determining the time it took to deposit this one-centimeter layer of clay.

They thought they could calculate this by measuring the amount of the element iridium (Ir) present in the clay.

Iridium has been scarce on Earth's surface since the planet's early history.

Due to its metallic nature, it was primarily incorporated into Earth's core during the planet's cooling and consolidation.

Iridium is found in high concentrations in certain meteorites, which preserve the original chemical composition of the solar system.

Even today, microscopic meteorites continuously fall on Earth, landing on both land and sea.

By measuring the number of these meteorites that reach Earth over a specific period, scientists can estimate the time it took to deposit the observed amount of iridium in the boundary clay.

These calculations suggest that approximately one million years would have been required.

However, other reliable evidence indicates that the deposition of the boundary clay could not have taken one million years.

Therefore, the unusually high concentration of iridium demands a special explanation.

Based on these facts, scientists hypothesized that a single large asteroid, approximately 10 to 15 kilometers in diameter, collided with Earth, and the resulting fallout created the boundary clay.

Their calculations indicate that the impact generated a dust cloud that blocked sunlight for several months, inhibiting photosynthesis in plants.

It also caused surface temperatures on continents to drop below freezing, triggered extreme episodes of acid rain, and significantly raised long-term global temperatures through the greenhouse effect.

This disruption of the food chain and climate would have led to the extinction of dinosaurs and other organisms within less than fifty years.
