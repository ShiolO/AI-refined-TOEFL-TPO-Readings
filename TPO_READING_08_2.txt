Extinction of the Dinosaurs

Paleontologists have long argued that the extinction of dinosaurs was caused by climatic changes associated with the shifting positions of continents and seas due to plate tectonics.

Throughout the Cretaceous period (the final period of the Mesozoic era, when dinosaurs thrived), large shallow seas covered vast areas of the continents.

Data from various sources, including geochemical evidence preserved in seafloor sediments, indicate that the Late Cretaceous climate was milder than today's.

The days were not excessively hot, nor the nights too cold.

Summers were not overly warm, nor winters too frigid.

The shallow seas likely regulated the temperature of the nearby air, maintaining relative stability.

Towards the end of the Cretaceous, the geological record reveals that these seaways receded from the continents and returned to the major ocean basins.

The reason for this retreat remains unknown.

Over a span of approximately 100,000 years, as the seas withdrew, global climates became significantly more extreme: hotter days, cooler nights;

hotter summers, colder winters.

It is possible that dinosaurs could not adapt to these drastic temperature changes and ultimately became extinct.

However, if this were true, why did cold-blooded animals such as snakes, lizards, turtles, and crocodiles survive the freezing winters and scorching summers?

These animals rely on the climate to maintain a livable body temperature.

It is difficult to comprehend why they would remain unaffected while dinosaurs were unable to cope, especially if, as some scientists believe, dinosaurs were warm-blooded.

Critics also point out that the shallow seaways had receded from and advanced on the continents multiple times during the Mesozoic era.

So why did dinosaurs survive the climatic changes associated with earlier fluctuations but not this particular one?

Although initially appealing, the hypothesis of a simple climatic change related to sea levels is insufficient to explain all the available data.

Dissatisfaction with conventional explanations for dinosaur extinctions led to a surprising observation that, in turn, has given rise to a new hypothesis.

Many plants and animals abruptly disappear from the fossil record as one transitions from layers of rock documenting the end of the Cretaceous to rocks representing the beginning of the Cenozoic era (the era following the Mesozoic).

Often, there is a thin layer of clay between the last layer of Cretaceous rock and the first layer of Cenozoic rock.

Scientists sought to estimate the duration of the extinctions by determining the time it took to deposit this one centimeter-thick layer of clay.

They believed that the amount of the element iridium (Ir) contained in the clay could provide insights into the deposition time.

Iridium has not been abundant on Earth since the planet's early history.

Due to its metallic state, it was primarily incorporated into Earth's core as the planet cooled and solidified.

Iridium is found in high concentrations in some meteorites, which preserve the original chemical composition of the solar system.

Even today, microscopic meteorites continuously bombard Earth, falling on both land and sea.

By measuring the number of these meteorites that reach Earth over a specific period, scientists can estimate the time it might have taken to deposit the observed amount of Ir in the boundary clay.

These calculations suggest that approximately one million years would have been required.

However, other reliable evidence indicates that the deposition of the boundary clay could not have taken one million years.

Therefore, the unusually high concentration of Ir demands a special explanation.

Based on these facts, scientists hypothesized that a single large asteroid, approximately 10 to 15 kilometers in diameter, collided with Earth, and the resulting fallout created the boundary clay.

Their calculations indicate that the impact generated a dust cloud that blocked sunlight for several months, hindering photosynthesis in plants.

It also caused surface temperatures on continents to drop below freezing, triggered extreme episodes of acid rain, and significantly raised long-term global temperatures through the greenhouse effect.

This disruption of the food chain and climate would have led to the extinction of dinosaurs and other organisms in less than fifty years.
