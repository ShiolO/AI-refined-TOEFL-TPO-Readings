Urban Heat Islands

Climatic changes, such as temperature, precipitation, humidity, or wind speed, resulting from urbanization, involve all major surface conditions.

Some changes are obvious and easy to measure, while others are subtle and challenging to quantify.

The degree of change in these elements depends on various factors, including the size of the urban area, industrial activities, site characteristics like topography and proximity to water bodies, time of day, and existing weather conditions.

The most extensively studied and well-documented urban climatic effect is the urban heat island.

This term refers to the phenomenon where temperatures within cities are generally higher than in rural areas.

The presence of a heat island becomes apparent when analyzing temperature data.

For instance, when examining the distribution of average minimum temperatures in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area during the three-month winter period (December through February) over a five-year period, a well-established heat island is clearly observed.

The warmest winter temperatures occur in the city center, while the suburbs and surrounding countryside experience average minimum temperatures that are up to 3.3℃ lower.

It's important to note that these temperatures are averages, as on many clear and calm nights, the temperature difference between the city center and the countryside can be even greater, often reaching 11℃ or more.

Conversely, on overcast or windy nights, the temperature difference approaches zero degrees.

The significant transformation of rural areas into cities is a primary cause of the urban heat island.

Firstly, the tall buildings, concrete, and asphalt in cities absorb and retain more solar radiation compared to the vegetation and soil found in rural areas.

Additionally, the impermeable city surfaces result in rapid runoff after rainfall, leading to a significant reduction in evaporation rates.

Consequently, the heat that would have been used for water evaporation now contributes to an increase in surface temperature.

During the night, while both the city and the countryside cool through radiative losses, the city's stone-like surfaces gradually release the accumulated heat from the day, maintaining warmer urban air compared to the surrounding areas.

A portion of the urban temperature rise can also be attributed to waste heat generated by activities such as home heating and air conditioning, power generation, industry, and transportation.

Numerous studies have shown that the amount of human-generated energy in metropolitan areas far exceeds the energy received from the Sun at the surface.

For example, investigations in Sheffield, England, and Berlin, Germany, revealed that the annual heat production in those cities was approximately one-third of the energy received from solar radiation.

Another study conducted in densely populated Manhattan, New York City, found that during winter, the heat produced by combustion alone was 2 ? times greater than the amount of solar energy reaching the ground.

In summer, this figure dropped to 1/6.

There are other, less significant, factors contributing to the heat island effect.

For instance, the presence of pollutants over a city creates a blanket that absorbs a portion of the long-wave radiation emitted from the surface and re-emits it back to the ground.

The complex three-dimensional structure of a city also plays a role.

The vertical walls of office buildings, stores, and apartments hinder the escape of radiation compared to the relatively flat surfaces in rural areas.

As these structures release stored heat, a portion is re-radiated between buildings rather than upward, resulting in slow dissipation.

Tall buildings not only re-radiate heat but also alter the airflow patterns.

Due to increased surface roughness, wind speeds within urban areas are reduced.

Estimates based on available records suggest a decrease of approximately 25 percent compared to rural areas.

Lower wind speeds limit ventilation within the city by impeding the influx of cooler outside air, which, if allowed to penetrate, would help reduce the higher temperatures in the city center.
