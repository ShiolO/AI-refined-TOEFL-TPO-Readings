Crop Engineering

Crop engineering has evolved from a long history of genetic manipulation in agriculture.

Human impact and its associated effects have been evident in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide since ancient times.

Our ancestors, who were omnivores, consumed various plant and animal materials they encountered.

Even then, humans had a significant impact on the environment.

They reduced animal populations through hunting and unintentionally spread plant seeds as they migrated, leading to changes in plant distribution.

The realization that seeds could provide a stable food supply through agriculture likely occurred when humans observed plants growing from discarded or defecated seeds in wastelands or along forest paths.

This realization led to a more organized approach to agriculture, which began approximately eight to ten thousand years ago in multiple locations globally.

The Near East witnessed diverse farming practices involving legumes, cereals, flax, sesame, and fruit trees.

Concurrently, New World inhabitants cultivated beans, maize, squashes, and potatoes, while Asian farmers started growing rice.

These early domesticated crops foreshadowed the significant transformations that contemporary agriculture has brought to plants.

Humans learned to distinguish crop varieties from wild types to prevent undesirable characteristics from mingling with desirable ones.

Continuous selection of crops with favorable traits increased the distinction between wild and managed plants, resulting in reduced diversity and limited variation in today's crops.

The simplest method of crop selection is preferentially saving seeds from plants with beneficial traits.

Early farmers selected plants with large seeds and fruits, increased seed production, lack of dormancy, faster germination, higher annual yield, and reduced seed scattering.

This initial selection successively intensified the impact of agriculture on crop diversity and wild plants.

Crops became commodities, traded and transported across vast areas, extending their distribution beyond their original ranges.

Three phenomena have characterized the recent impact of agriculture on Earth.

Firstly, the exponential growth of the human population, doubling at increasingly shorter intervals over the past millennium, has led to expanded cultivation areas and a fundamental shift from wild to managed ecosystems.

By 1998, the global cultivated land area exceeded 3,410,523,800 acres, surpassing the size of the United States.

Entire ecosystems have vanished, while others remain threatened.

The sheer number of people and the extent of farmland have been significant drivers of biological change.

The second factor shaping our planet is European colonization.

This period witnessed an unprecedented global dispersal of biological materials.

Maize, tomatoes, and potatoes were transported from the New World to the Old, while wheat, rye, and barley were carried from the Old World to the New.

Rice, soybeans, and alfalfa were introduced from Asia to various arable continents.

These introductions not only brought unique plant species but also introduced plant pests and diseases, which currently pose significant challenges for pest management worldwide.

The third factor influencing agriculture and the environment is the increasing precision in crop selection and breeding.

This progress can be attributed to various advancements, with two individuals at the forefront: the English naturalist Charles Darwin and the Austrian monk Gregor Mendel.

Although the concepts of evolution and genetics were not solely their work, they were pioneers in synthesizing the concepts of natural selection and inheritance.

These concepts form the foundation of contemporary biological science and have facilitated the growth of biotechnology.
