Human Activity and the Archaeological Record

Archaeologists differentiate between the "cultural" formation processes of the archaeological record (involving human activity) and the "natural" formation processes (involving nonhuman activity, such as river action disturbing archaeological material).

There are two types of cultural formation processes: those that reflect the original human behavior and activity before a find or site became buried, and those (such as looting) that occurred after burial.

However, it should be noted that most major archaeological sites are formed through a complex sequence of use, burial, and reuse, making the simple twofold division of cultural formation processes less applicable in practice, although still useful.

Archaeological evidence often reflects at least four major activities related to original human behavior.

For example, in the case of a tool, there may be (1) acquisition of the raw material, (2) manufacture, (3) use, and (4) disposal or discard when the tool is worn out or broken.

(The tool may be reworked and recycled, repeating stages 2 and 3.)

Similarly, a food crop like wheat goes through acquisition (harvesting), manufacture (processing), use (consumption), and discard (digestion and excretion of waste products).

It is worth mentioning that storage before use is a common intermediate stage for food crops.

From the perspective of an archaeologist, the crucial factor is that remains can enter the archaeological record at any of these stages.

For instance, a tool may be lost or discarded during manufacture due to inferior quality, or a crop may be accidentally burnt and preserved during processing.

Therefore, accurately reconstructing the original activity requires understanding which stage is being examined.

Identifying the first stage for stone tools, for example, is relatively easy as stone quarries can often be recognized by deep holes in the ground with piles of associated waste flakes.

However, determining the exact origin of a sample of charred plant remains, such as whether it comes from an area where harvested wheat was taken for threshing or from the area where the grain was consumed, is much more challenging.

This difficulty may also hinder the reconstruction of the true plant diet, as certain activities may favor the preservation of specific plant species.

The deliberate burial of valuables or the dead is another human behavior that has left its mark on the archaeological record.

During times of conflict or war, people often bury prized possessions in the ground with the intention of reclaiming them later.

However, sometimes they fail to do so for various reasons.

These buried hoards serve as valuable evidence for certain periods, such as the European Bronze Age, where hoards of metal goods are common, or later Roman Britain, which has yielded buried treasures of silver and other precious metals.

Differentiating between hoards originally intended for reclamation and valuables buried as offerings to supernatural powers, with no intention of reclamation, can be challenging for archaeologists.

In addition to burial hoards, a significant source of archaeological evidence comes from the burial of the dead, whether in simple graves, elaborate burial mounds, or giant pyramids.

These burials often include grave goods such as ceramic vessels or weapons, and sometimes feature painted tomb-chamber walls, as seen in ancient Mexico or Egypt.

The Egyptians even went as far as mummifying their dead, hoping to preserve them for eternity.

Similarly, the Incas of Peru kept their kings in the Temple of the Sun at Cuzco and brought them outside for special ceremonies.

Human destruction of the archaeological record can occur when burials, like those described earlier, are dug into earlier deposits.

However, in numerous other ways, people in the past deliberately or accidentally obliterated traces of their predecessors.

Rulers often destroyed monuments or erased inscriptions belonging to previous chiefs or monarchs.

On the other hand, some human destruction intended to obliterate has inadvertently preserved material for archaeologists to discover.

For example, burning may not always result in complete destruction.

Clay daubing and adobe usually decay, but if a structure has been burned, the mud is baked to the consistency of a brick.
