The Geologic History of the Mediterranean

In 1970, geologists Kenneth J. Hsu and William B.F. Ryan conducted research aboard the oceanographic research vessel Glomar Challenger to investigate the geologic history of the Mediterranean.

One particular question they sought to answer was the abrupt change in the invertebrate fauna (animals without spines) of the Mediterranean approximately 6 million years ago.

Most of the older organisms were nearly wiped out, although a few resilient species survived.

Some species managed to migrate into the Atlantic and later returned, bringing new species with them.

The reasons behind this near extinction and migration phenomenon were unknown.

Another objective of the scientists aboard the Glomar Challenger was to determine the origin of the dome-like masses buried deep beneath the Mediterranean seafloor.

These structures had been previously detected by echo-sounding instruments, but no drilling had been done to penetrate them.

Were they salt domes similar to those commonly found along the United States Gulf Coast?

If so, why was there such a significant amount of solid crystalline salt beneath the Mediterranean floor?

With these questions in mind, the scientists embarked on their journey aboard the Glomar Challenger to find answers.

On August 23, 1970, they retrieved a sample consisting of pebbles of hardened sediment that had once been soft, deep-sea mud, as well as granules of gypsum and fragments of volcanic rock.

Interestingly, not a single pebble was found to have originated from the nearby continent.

In the following days, solid gypsum samples were repeatedly brought on deck as drilling operations penetrated the seafloor.

The gypsum exhibited peculiarities in composition and structure that suggested its formation in desert flats.

Sediment above and below the gypsum layer contained tiny marine fossils, indicating open-ocean conditions.

As the scientists drilled into the central and deepest part of the Mediterranean basin, they extracted solid, shiny, crystalline salt from the core barrel.

Interspersed with the salt were thin layers of what appeared to be windblown silt.

It was time to formulate a hypothesis.

The investigators theorized that approximately 20 million years ago, the Mediterranean was a wide seaway connected to the Atlantic by two narrow straits.

Crustal movements eventually closed off these straits, transforming the Mediterranean into a landlocked body of water that began to evaporate.

The increasing salinity resulting from evaporation led to the extinction of numerous invertebrate species, leaving only a few organisms capable of surviving in highly salty conditions.

As evaporation continued, the remaining brine (salt water) became so dense that it precipitated calcium sulfate, forming the hard layer.

In the central and deeper parts of the basin, the last of the brine evaporated, causing more soluble sodium chloride (salt) to precipitate.

Eventually, under the weight of overlying sediments, this salt flowed plastically upward, forming salt domes.

However, before this occurred, the Mediterranean was a vast desert with a depth of 3,000 meters.

Then, approximately 5.5 million years ago, a deluge took place.

Crustal adjustments and faulting caused the Strait of Gibraltar, where the Mediterranean now connects to the Atlantic, to open, resulting in a spectacular influx of water back into the Mediterranean.

Turbulent waters eroded and fragmented the hardened salt flats, creating the pebbles observed in the initial sample taken by the Challenger.

As the basin refilled, normal marine organisms returned, and layers of oceanic ooze began to accumulate above the old hard layer.

The presence of salt, gypsum, faunal changes, and unusual gravel provided ample evidence that the Mediterranean was once a desert.
