Early Settlements in Southwest Asia

The global warming that occurred at the end of the Ice Age had significant effects on temperate regions in Asia, Europe, and North America.

Ice sheets receded, and sea levels rose.

The climatic changes in Southwest Asia were more subtle, involving shifts in mountain snow lines, rainfall patterns, and vegetation cover.

However, these changes had a profound impact on the sparse human populations in the region.

At the end of the Ice Age, only a few thousand foragers lived along the eastern Mediterranean coast, in the Jordan and Euphrates valleys.

Within 2,000 years, the human population in the region grew to tens of thousands due to village life and farming.

Thanks to new environmental and archaeological discoveries, we now have some understanding of this remarkable transformation in local life.

Pollen samples from freshwater lakes in Syria and other areas indicate that forest cover expanded rapidly at the end of the Ice Age.

The climate in Southwest Asia was cooler and considerably wetter than it is today.

Many areas were richer in animal and plant species, making them highly suitable for human habitation.

Around 9000 B.C., most human settlements were located along the Mediterranean coast and in the Zagros Mountains of Iran and their foothills.

Some local areas, such as the Jordan River valley, the middle Euphrates valley, and certain Zagros valleys, had higher population densities.

These regions saw the flourishing of sedentary and complex societies.

The inhabitants extensively exploited the landscape, gathering wild cereal grasses and nuts from hill slopes, while hunting gazelle and other game in grassy lowlands and river valleys.

Their settlements contained exotic objects, such as seashells, stone bowls, and artifacts made of obsidian (volcanic glass), which were traded from distant regions.

This extensive intercommunity exchange led to increased social complexity.

Through meticulous excavation and the use of flotation methods (which recover seeds from soil samples), we have gained substantial knowledge about the foraging practices of the inhabitants of Abu Hureyra in Syria's Euphrates valley.

1Abu Hureyra was established around 9500 B.C. It was a small village settlement with cramped pit dwellings (partially dug into the soil) and reed roofs supported by wooden uprights.

For the next 1,500 years, its inhabitants enjoyed a somewhat warmer and wetter climate than today.

They lived in a well-wooded steppe area abundant in wild cereal grasses.

They relied on the spring migrations of Persian gazelles from the south for sustenance.

With such favorable conditions, a sizable permanent settlement of about 300 to 400 people emerged.

They no longer lived in small bands but formed a large community with more complex social organization, likely organized into clans based on common descent.

The flotation samples from the excavations allowed botanists to study shifts in plant-collecting habits, providing insights into the changing landscape.

Hundreds of tiny plant remains revealed how the inhabitants exploited nut harvests in nearby pistachio and oak forests.

However, as the climate became drier, the forests receded from the vicinity of the settlement.

The inhabitants turned to collecting wild cereal grasses in large quantities, while the proportion of nuts in their diet decreased.

By 8200 B.C., drought conditions became so severe that the people abandoned their long-established settlement, possibly dispersing into smaller camps.

Five centuries later, around 7700 B.C., a new village emerged on the mound.

Initially, the inhabitants continued intensive gazelle hunting.

Then, within a few generations around 7000 B.C., they abruptly transitioned to herding domesticated goats and sheep and cultivating einkorn, pulses, and other cereal grasses.

Abu Hureyra experienced rapid growth, eventually covering nearly 30 acres.

It was a tightly-knit community of rectangular, one-story mud-brick houses interconnected by narrow lanes and courtyards.

The settlement was finally abandoned around 5000 B.C. Various complex factors contributed to the adoption of these new economies, not only at Abu Hureyra but also at other locations such as 'Ain Ghazal in Syria, where the presence of goat toe bones with abrasion marks caused by foot tethering indicates early herding of domesticated animals.
