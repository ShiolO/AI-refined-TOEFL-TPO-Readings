William Smith

In 1769, a child named William Smith was born into a poor family of a village blacksmith in a small town in Oxfordshire, England.

He received basic education in the village but spent most of his time exploring his uncle's farm and collecting fossils from the rocks in the Cotswold hills.

As he grew older, William Smith taught himself surveying by purchasing books with his savings.

At the age of eighteen, he became an apprentice to a local parish surveyor.

He also self-studied geology and later joined a company that was excavating the Somerset Coal Canal in southern England when he turned twenty-four.

During that time, steam locomotives were not yet invented, and canal construction was booming.

The canal companies required surveyors to locate valuable coal deposits and determine the optimal routes for the canals.

This job provided Smith with the opportunity to study the newly exposed rock formations resulting from the canal excavation.

He continued working on similar projects throughout England, diligently studying the revealed strata and collecting fossils.

Smith traveled extensively, covering up to 10,000 miles per year using mail coaches.

In 1815, he published the first modern geological map titled "A Map of the Strata of England and Wales with a Part of Scotland."

This meticulously researched map remains relevant even today.

In 1831, the Geological Society of London finally recognized Smith as the "father of English geology."

His recognition was not only for his maps but also for something even more significant.

Since the early days of cataloging rock formations, there had been a hope of using them to determine geological time.

However, as more strata were cataloged in various locations, it became evident that rock sequences sometimes differed from one region to another.

It was clear that no rock type could serve as a reliable global time marker.

Even without regional differences, rocks posed a challenge as unique time indicators.

Quartz, for example, remains the same regardless of whether it was formed 500 million years ago in the Cambrian period or two million years ago in the Pleistocene period.

Quartz is composed of a silicon ion surrounded by four oxygen ions.

While collecting fossils from different strata across England, Smith noticed that fossils told a different story compared to rocks.

In younger strata, the rocks often appeared similar, making it difficult to distinguish between them.

However, the fossils were always distinct.

Although the rock composition might vary between shale and sandstone in different locations, the fossils within those rocks remained consistent.

Some fossils persisted across millions of years and appeared in multiple strata, while others were limited to specific strata.

Certain species even experienced birth and extinction within a particular stratum.

Fossils, therefore, serve as identifying markers for specific periods in Earth's history.

Smith not only identified rock strata based on the fossils they contained but also observed a pattern.

Certain fossils consistently appeared in older sediments, while others emerged in more recent strata.

By following the fossils, Smith successfully arranged all the strata in England's earth in relative temporal sequence.

Around the same time, Georges Cuvier made a similar discovery while studying rocks near Paris.

It was soon realized that this principle of faunal succession applied not only to England and France but also to virtually every location.

The principle also extended to floral succession, as plants exhibited transformations over time, similar to fauna.

For instance, limestone could be found in Cambrian or Jurassic strata, separated by 300 million years, but a trilobite-a common marine arthropod that originated in the Cambrian-would never be found in Jurassic strata, just as a dinosaur would not be found in the Cambrian period.
