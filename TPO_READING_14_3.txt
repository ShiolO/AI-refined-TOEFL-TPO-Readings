Pastoralism in Ancient Inner Eurasia

Pastoralism is a lifestyle in which economic activity is primarily based on livestock.

Archaeological evidence suggests that by 3000 B.C., and perhaps even earlier, distinctive types of pastoralism had emerged on the steppes of Inner Eurasia, which would dominate the region's history for several millennia.

The horse was already gaining prestige in many regions, although sheep, goats, and cattle also played vital roles.

The use of horses for transportation and warfare explains why Inner Eurasian pastoralism was the most mobile and militaristic among all major forms of pastoralism.

The emergence and spread of pastoralism had a profound impact on the history of Inner Eurasia and indirectly influenced the surrounding areas of Asia and Europe.

In particular, pastoralism favors a mobile lifestyle, which helps explain the impact of pastoralist societies on this part of the world.

The mobility of pastoralist societies reflects their dependence on animal-based food.

While agriculturalists rely on domesticated plants, pastoralists rely on domesticated animals.

As a result, pastoralists, like carnivores in general, occupy a higher position in the food chain.

All else being equal, this means they must exploit larger areas of land than agriculturalists to secure the same amount of food, clothing, and other necessities.

Therefore, pastoralism is a more extensive lifeway than farming.

However, the larger the terrain used to support a group, the more challenging it is to exploit that terrain while remaining in one place.

Thus, basic ecological principles imply a strong tendency toward nomadism (a mobile lifestyle) within pastoralist lifeways.

As archaeologist Roger Cribb puts it, "The greater the degree of pastoralism, the stronger the tendency toward nomadism."

A modern Turkic nomad interviewed by Cribb commented, "The more animals you have, the farther you have to move."

Nomadism has further consequences.

It means that pastoralist societies occupy and can influence very large territories.

This is particularly true of horse pastoralism, which emerged in the Inner Eurasian steppes as the most mobile of all major forms of pastoralism.

Therefore, it is no accident that the appearance of pastoralist societies coincides with the emergence of large areas sharing similar cultural, ecological, and even linguistic features.

By the late fourth millennium B.C., there is already evidence of large culture zones extending from Eastern Europe to the western borders of Mongolia.

Perhaps the most striking sign of mobility is that by the third millennium B.C., most pastoralists in this vast region spoke related languages ancestral to the modern Indo-European languages.

The remarkable mobility and range of pastoral societies partly explain why many linguists argue that the Indo-European languages began their expansionist career not among farmers in Anatolia (present-day Turkey), but among early pastoralists from Inner Eurasia.

Such theories imply that the Indo-European languages evolved not in Neolithic (10,000 to 3,000 B.C.)

Anatolia, but among the foraging communities of the cultures in the region of the Don and Dnieper rivers, which adopted stock breeding and began to exploit the neighboring steppes.

Nomadism also subjects pastoralist communities to strict rules of portability.

If you are constantly on the move, you cannot afford to accumulate large material surpluses.

These rules limit variations in accumulated material goods between pastoralist households (although they may also encourage a preference for portable goods of high value, such as silks or jewelry).

Therefore, nomadism generally implies a high degree of self-sufficiency and inhibits the emergence of an extensive division of labor.

Inequalities of wealth and rank certainly exist and have likely existed in most pastoralist societies.

However, except during periods of military conquest, these inequalities are usually too slight to generate stable, hereditary hierarchies typically associated with the term "class."

Inequalities of gender have also existed in pastoralist societies, but they seem to have been mitigated by the absence of steep hierarchies of wealth in most communities and the requirement for women to acquire most of the skills of men, including their military skills.
