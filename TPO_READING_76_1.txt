Europe's Early Sea Trade with Asia

In the 14th century, several political developments disrupted Europe's overland trade routes to southern and eastern Asia, which had been crucial and highly profitable since the 12th century.

This situation, occurring during a period of economic decline in Europe, fueled the long-standing desire to establish direct relations with the East through sea trade.

Accounts from notable figures like Marco Polo, the renowned traveler from Venice, reported the willingness of Chinese people to trade with Europeans and the immense wealth that could be gained from such contact.

These reports, although somewhat distrusted, made the idea irresistible.

While the prospects for trade seemed promising, the traditional land routes were no longer viable.

A new approach had to be found.

The main challenge was technological: How could Europeans reach the East?

Europe's maritime tradition had developed in the context of easily navigable seas such as the Mediterranean, the Baltic, and to a lesser extent, the North Sea between England and the Continent.

Vast oceans posed a different set of challenges.

New types of ships, navigation methods, and financing techniques were required for such an ambitious endeavor.

The scale of investment needed to initiate commercial expansion at sea reflected the potential profits that could be generated.

The most sought-after commodities were spices, which not only enhanced the taste of European cuisine but were also used in perfume production and certain medicines.

However, transporting high-value commodities like spices required large quantities to justify the expense and effort of sailing around the African continent to India and China.

During the Middle Ages, the primary seagoing vessel was the galley, a long and low ship propelled primarily by oars but equipped with sails.

The largest galleys could have up to 50 oarsmen.

Due to their relatively shallow hulls, they were unstable when driven by sails or in rough waters, making them unsuitable for the voyage to the East.

Even if they followed the African coastline, their chances of surviving a crossing of the Indian Ocean were slim.

Around 1400, shipbuilders began developing a new type of vessel specifically designed for rough, open water: the caravel.

It had a wider and deeper hull than the galley, allowing for greater cargo capacity.

Increased stability enabled the addition of multiple masts and sails.

In the largest caravels, two main masts carried large square sails that provided the majority of the thrust, while a smaller forward mast held a maneuverable triangular-shaped sail called a lateen sail.

The astrolabe had been the primary navigation instrument since the 11th century.

It measured the height of the Sun and fixed stars to determine latitude by calculating the angles formed by these points.

(The problem of determining longitude was not solved until the 18th century.)

By the early 13th century, Western Europeans had also adopted and utilized the magnetic compass, which aided navigation when clouds obscured celestial bodies.

Additionally, new maps based on precise calculations and sailors' reports emerged in the 13th century, enabling reasonably accurate tracking of one's course.

Certain institutional and practical norms were also established.

The Consulate of the Sea, a maritime code originating in the western Mediterranean region in the 14th century, gained acceptance as the standard code of conduct for maritime affairs.

It covered matters such as the authority of ship officers, command protocols, pay structures, sailors' rights, and rules of engagement when encountering other ships at sea.

By around 1400, the essential elements were in place for Europe to embark on its maritime adventure.
