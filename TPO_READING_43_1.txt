The Empire of Alexander the Great

In 334 B.C., Alexander the Great led his Greek armies to the east and, within a few years, successfully established an empire encompassing a significant portion of southwest Asia.

This new empire facilitated the removal of trade barriers and the movement of people, connecting markets and fostering economic interactions.

Consequently, thousands of Greek traders and artisans ventured into this expanded world in pursuit of their fortunes.

Alexander's actions had several significant consequences for the region under his rule.

Firstly, Greek civilization experienced a remarkable expansion throughout the Middle East.

Greek became the dominant international language, and towns and cities were not only established as military garrisons but also as centers for the dissemination of Greek language, literature, and philosophy.

Libraries, such as those in Antioch (in modern-day Turkey) and the renowned library in Alexandria, Egypt, which remained unrivaled for the next millennium, played a crucial role in this cultural diffusion.

Secondly, this internationalism marked the decline of the classical Greek city-state, which had served as the fundamental unit of government in ancient Greece.

Most city-states were relatively small in terms of population, and this was considered advantageous.

The agora, an open marketplace, served as the focal point of civic life, where assemblies were held and discussions on various topics, including the purpose of government and the relationship between law and freedom, took place.

The philosopher Plato (428-348 B.C.) believed that an ideal city-state should consist of approximately 5,000 citizens, as it was essential for everyone in the community to know each other.

According to Plato, collective decision-making by the citizens, despite their individual qualifications, would generally lead to the correct outcomes.

However, the philosopher Aristotle (384-322 B.C.), who lived during the decline of the city-state system, argued that a political entity with 100,000 citizens would struggle to govern itself effectively.

The city-state's foundation rested on the notion that citizens were not specialists but possessed diverse interests and talents.

They were considered "jacks-of-all-trades" capable of engaging in various aspects of life and politics.

This approach reflected a respect for the interconnectedness of life and a disdain for specialization.

It also emphasized economic and military self-sufficiency.

However, with the growth of trade and commerce in Alexander's empire, cities flourished, and the concept of being a "jack-of-all-trades" became impractical.

Specialization became necessary, leading to the emergence of professionalism.

The increasing number of individuals made it impossible for everyone to know each other, and a sense of shared interests gave way to a multitude of diverse interests.

The city-state became inadequate for these changing circumstances.

Thirdly, Greek philosophy encountered the philosophies and religions of the East.

During the height of the Greek city-state, religion played a significant role, with gods like Zeus, the father of the gods, and his wife Hera, being perceived as superhuman beings resembling humans.

Religious practices were closely tied to life's milestones, such as birth, marriage, and death, as well as protection against danger, prophecy, and healing.

However, there was little emphasis on a code of behavior or an elaborate theory of the afterlife.

Even before Alexander's time, the ideal of dedicating one's life to the service of the city-state no longer held sway among the Greeks.

The Athenian philosopher Socrates (470-399 B.C.) was the first to propose a morality based on individual conscience rather than the dictates of the state.

For this, he was accused of disbelief in the city's gods, corrupting the youth, and ultimately sentenced to death.

Greek philosophy, although complementary to religion, was not a substitute for it.

This openness to new ideas and religious systems from the Middle East, even if not fully embraced, allowed for the blending of Middle Eastern and Greek cultures, spreading across the world in the post-Alexander era.
