Desert Formation

Deserts, which already occupy approximately a quarter of the Earth's land surface, have been expanding at an alarming pace in recent decades.

The expansion of desert-like conditions into previously unaffected areas is known as desertification.

It has been estimated that an additional quarter of the Earth's land surface is threatened by this process.

Desertification primarily occurs due to the loss of natural vegetation that stabilizes the soil, leading to accelerated erosion by wind and water.

In some cases, the loose soil is completely blown away, leaving a stony surface.

In other cases, finer particles are removed while sand-sized particles accumulate, forming mobile hills or sand ridges.

Even in areas with soil cover, the reduction of vegetation typically results in the soil's decreased ability to absorb significant amounts of water.

Raindrops impact the loose soil, transferring fine clay particles into the smallest soil spaces, sealing them and creating a surface that allows minimal water penetration.

Water absorption is greatly reduced, resulting in increased runoff and accelerated erosion rates.

The gradual drying of the soil, caused by its diminished water absorption capacity, further contributes to the loss of vegetation, establishing a cycle of progressive surface deterioration.

In some regions, the expansion of desert areas is largely attributed to a trend towards drier climatic conditions.

Continued global warming has led to increased aridity in certain areas over the past few thousand years.

If air pollution-induced global warming continues to worsen, the process may be further accelerated in the coming decades.

However, there is little doubt that desertification in most areas primarily stems from human activities rather than natural processes.

The semiarid lands bordering deserts exist in a delicate ecological balance and have limited potential to adapt to increased environmental pressures.

Expanding populations exert increasing pressure on the land to provide food and fuel.

During dry periods, which are common along desert margins, the pressure on the land often exceeds its diminished capacity, resulting in desertification.

Four specific activities have been identified as major contributors to the desertification processes: overcultivation, overgrazing, firewood gathering, and overirrigation.

Cultivation of crops has expanded into progressively drier regions as population densities have increased.

These regions are particularly prone to severe dryness, leading to frequent crop failures.

Since the cultivation of most crops requires the removal of natural vegetation, crop failures leave extensive areas devoid of plant cover, making them susceptible to wind and water erosion.

Livestock raising is a significant economic activity in semiarid lands, where grasses are typically the dominant type of natural vegetation.

Excessive grazing leads to reduced vegetation cover, soil trampling, and pulverization.

This is often followed by soil drying and accelerated erosion.

Firewood is the primary fuel used for cooking and heating in many countries.

The pressures of expanding populations have resulted in the removal of woody plants, leaving large areas surrounding cities and towns completely devoid of trees and shrubs.

The increasing use of dried animal waste as a substitute fuel has also negatively impacted the soil, as this valuable soil conditioner and source of plant nutrients are no longer returned to the land.

The final major human cause of desertification is soil salinization resulting from overirrigation.

Excess water from irrigation seeps into the water table.

Without proper drainage systems, the water table rises, bringing dissolved salts to the surface.

As the water evaporates, salts are left behind, forming a white crustal layer that hinders air and water from reaching the underlying soil.

The severity of desertification arises from the vast affected land areas and the significant number of people impacted, as well as the immense challenge of reversing or even slowing down the process.

Once soil has been eroded, it takes centuries or millennia for new soil to form.

However, in areas where substantial soil still remains, a strictly enforced program of land protection and cover-crop planting may offer the possibility of reversing the current surface deterioration.
