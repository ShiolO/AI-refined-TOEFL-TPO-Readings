Wind Pollination

Pollen, a powdery substance produced by flowering plants and containing male reproductive cells, is usually carried from plant to plant by insects or birds.

However, some plants rely on wind for pollen dispersal.

Wind pollination, although often considered primitive and inefficient in terms of pollen expenditure, is surprisingly common, especially in higher latitudes.

Wind is highly effective in transporting pollen over long distances, with the ability to carry it for hundreds of kilometers.

Only birds come close to matching this dispersal capability.

The downside is that wind is indiscriminate in its pollen transport.

It is akin to attempting to deliver a letter to a friend at the other end of the village by climbing onto the roof and tossing a handful of letters into the air, hoping that one will land in the friend's garden.

In the case of dominant tree species in temperate forests, where numerous individuals of the same species exist within pollen range, this gamble is relatively safe.

If multiple people in the village were throwing letters off roofs, your friend would likely receive one.

In contrast, in the tropics, where each tree species has few widely scattered individuals, the chances of wind-mediated pollen transfer to another individual are slim.

Consequently, animals serve as more reliable pollen transporters.

Even tall trees in windy tropical conditions are typically not wind pollinated.

Similarly, insect-pollinated trees in temperate forests tend to grow as solitary individuals, widely dispersed.

Since wind-pollinated flowers do not need to attract insects or other animals, they have dispensed with bright petals, nectar, and scent.

These features are, at best, wasteful and, at worst, hinder the airborne transfer of pollen.

As a result, wind-pollinated flowers and catkins (dense cylindrical clusters of small, petalless flowers) appear insignificant.

Wind pollination necessitates a substantial amount of pollen.

Birch and hazel trees, for instance, can produce 5.5 million and 4 million grains per catkin, respectively.

Various adaptations facilitate the dispersal of as much pollen as possible.

Most deciduous wind-pollinated trees, which shed their leaves every fall, produce pollen in the spring when the branches are bare, reducing the competing surfaces for pollen on the stigmas (the flower part that receives pollen).

Evergreen conifers, which do not shed their leaves, have less to gain from spring flowering.

Consequently, some conifers flower in the autumn or winter.

Pollen produced in the upper branches is more likely to travel greater distances due to increased windiness and gusts, enabling the pollen to be carried farther before reaching the ground.

Additionally, dangling catkins, such as those of hazel trees, retain the pollen until the wind is strong enough to bend them, ensuring that pollen is only released into the air during strong winds.

Weather conditions also play a role.

Pollen is primarily released when the air is dry to prevent excessive adhesion to wet surfaces or being knocked out of the air by rain.

Despite these adaptations, a significant portion of the pollen fails to disperse beyond the upper branches, and only between 0.5 percent and 40 percent travels more than 100 meters away from the parent tree.

However, once pollen reaches this distance, substantial quantities can travel a kilometer or more.

In fact, pollen can travel thousands of kilometers at high altitudes.

Given the abundance of airborne pollen, it is no surprise that wind-pollinated trees are a major source of allergies.

Once windborne pollen is released, its fate is subject to the whims of the wind.

However, not everything is left to chance.

Wind-dispersed pollen tends to be dry, rounded, smooth, and generally smaller than that of insect-pollinated plants.

Nevertheless, size presents a double-edged sword.

Smaller grains may be carried further, but they are also more likely to bypass waiting stigmas due to their tendency to remain trapped in the fast-moving air surrounding the stigma.

However, stigmas create turbulence, which reduces air speed around them and aids in pollen adhesion.
