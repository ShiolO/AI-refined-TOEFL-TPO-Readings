Roman Cultural Influence on Britain

After the Roman Empire's conquest of Britain in the 1st century A.D., the presence of administrators, merchants, and troops on British soil, along with the natural flow of ideas and goods from the rest of the empire, had a significant influence on life in the British Isles.

Cultural influences can be categorized into three types: the introduction of objects, the transfer of craft workers, and the implementation of massive civil architecture.

Many objects were not considered art in the broadest sense and consisted of utilitarian items such as clothing, utensils, and equipment.

The social status associated with these mundane possessions, which were previously unavailable, should not be underestimated.

The influx of red-gloss pottery from Gaul (modern-day France), adorned with scenes from Classical mythology, likely exposed many individuals to the styles and artistic concepts of the Greco-Roman world for the first time, regardless of whether they understood the symbolism.

Mass-produced goods were accompanied by fewer but more aesthetically impressive objects like statuettes.

These pieces were initially brought by officials for their own religious worship and later acquired by native leaders as diplomatic gifts or through purchase.

Once the natives saw such objects, they created a fashion trend that quickly spread throughout the province.

In the most extreme cases, natives fully embraced Roman culture.

The Fishbourne villa, constructed in the third quarter of the 1st century A.D., possibly for the native client king Cogidubnus, exemplifies his Roman aspirations.

It was built in the latest Italian style, using imported marbles and stylish mosaics.

The villa was lavishly furnished with imported sculptures and other Classical objects.

A visitor from Rome would have recognized the owner as a participant in the contemporary culture of the empire, rather than someone with provincial taste.

Even if those from traditional families looked down on him, they would not have been able to dismiss him as uncultured.

Although exceptional, this demonstrates how new cultural symbols connected provincials to the identity of the Roman world.

Such examples set a standard to be emulated.

One consequence was an influx of craft workers, particularly those skilled in artistic media like stone-carving, which did not exist before the conquest.

Civilian workers mostly came from Gaul and Germany.

The magnificent temple built beside the sacred spring at Bath was erected only about twenty years after the conquest.

Its intricate details indicate that it was carved by artists from northeast Gaul.

Without a tradition of Classical stone-carving and building, fulfilling the desire to develop Roman amenities would have been challenging.

Administrators utilized their personal connections to connect the Britons with architects and masons.

Given that many officials in Britain had strong ties with Gaul, it is not surprising that early Roman Britain owes much to craft workers from that region.

Local workshops did emerge, and stylistically similar groups of sculptures demonstrate the widespread adoption of skills in this new medium.

Similarly, skills in mosaic, wall painting, ceramic decoration, and metalworking developed throughout the province, eventually giving rise to distinct Romano-British styles.

This art had a significant impact on the native peoples, and one of the most important factors was a change in the scale of buildings.

Pre-Roman Britain was highly localized, with people rarely venturing beyond their own region.

Occasionally, large groups would gather for war or religious festivals, but society revolved around small communities.

The architecture of this era reflected this, with even the largest fortified towns and hill forts consisting of no more than clusters of medium-sized structures.

The interior spaces of even the largest roundhouses were modest, and the use of rounded shapes and organic building materials gave the buildings a human scale.

However, the influence of Roman civil architecture was profound.

The sheer size of spaces enclosed within buildings like the basilica of London must have been astonishing.

This architecture conveyed dominance, making subject peoples feel small in the presence of buildings that epitomized imperial power.

The supremacy was further emphasized by the rigid straight lines of both individual buildings and planned settlements, which contrasted sharply with the natural curvilinear shapes prevalent in the native realm.
