Petroleum Resources

Petroleum, consisting of crude oil and natural gas, appears to originate from organic matter in marine sediment.

Microscopic organisms settle on the seafloor and accumulate in marine mud.

The organic matter may partially decompose, depleting the dissolved oxygen in the sediment.

Once the oxygen is depleted, decay ceases, and the remaining organic matter is preserved.

Continued sedimentation, the process of deposits settling on the sea bottom, buries the organic matter and subjects it to higher temperatures and pressures, which convert the organic matter into oil and gas.

As muddy sediments are compressed, the gas and small droplets of oil may be squeezed out of the mud and migrate into nearby sandy layers.

Over extended periods of time (millions of years), accumulations of gas and oil can gather in the sandy layers.

Both oil and gas are less dense than water, so they generally tend to rise upward through water-saturated rock and sediment.

Oil pools are valuable underground accumulations of oil, and oil fields are regions underlain by one or more oil pools.

Once an oil pool or field is discovered, wells are drilled into the ground.

Permanent towers, known as derricks, used to be constructed to handle the long sections of drilling pipe.

Nowadays, portable drilling machines are set up, dismantled, and removed.

When the well reaches a pool, oil usually ascends the well due to its density difference with the water beneath it or the pressure of expanding gas trapped above it.

Although the rise of oil is almost always carefully controlled today, spouts of oil, or gushers, were common in the past.

Gas pressure gradually diminishes, and oil is pumped from the well.

Water or steam may be injected into adjacent wells to help push the oil out.

At a refinery, the crude oil from underground is separated into natural gas, gasoline, kerosene, and various oils.

Petrochemicals such as dyes, fertilizer, and plastic are also manufactured from petroleum.

As the search for oil becomes increasingly challenging, exploration is extended to more hostile environments.

The development of the oil field on the North Slope of Alaska and the construction of the Alaska pipeline exemplify the significant expense and difficulty involved in new oil discoveries.

Offshore drilling platforms expand the search for oil to the ocean's continental shelves, which are gently sloping submarine regions at the edges of the continents.

Despite offshore drilling being six to seven times more expensive than land drilling, over one-quarter of the world's oil and almost one-fifth of the world's natural gas come from offshore sources.

A significant portion of this oil and gas is extracted from beneath the North Sea between Great Britain and Norway.

Of course, there is far more oil underground than can be recovered.

It may be in a pool that is too small or too distant from a potential market to justify the expense of drilling.

Some oil lies under regions where drilling is prohibited, such as national parks or other public lands.

Even with the best extraction techniques, only about 30 to 40 percent of the oil in a given pool can be brought to the surface.

The remainder is too challenging to extract and must remain underground.

Furthermore, extracting petroleum from the ground and underwater and delivering it to consumers can create environmental problems at various stages.

Pipelines carrying oil can be ruptured by faults or landslides, resulting in significant oil spills.

Spillage from large oil-carrying cargo ships, known as tankers, involved in collisions or accidental groundings (such as the one off Alaska in 1989), can create oil slicks at sea.

Offshore platforms may also experience oil leaks, leading to oil slicks that drift ashore and pollute beaches, causing harm to the environment.

Sometimes, the ground at an oil field may subside as oil is extracted.

The Wilmington field near Long Beach, California, has subsided nine meters in 50 years, necessitating the construction of protective barriers to prevent seawater from flooding the area.

Finally, the refining and combustion of petroleum and its products can contribute to air pollution.

However, advancing technology and stringent laws are helping to mitigate some of these adverse environmental effects.
