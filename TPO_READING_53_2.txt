Rainforest Soils

When observing the abundant plant growth in a tropical rainforest, it is commonly assumed that the soil beneath it is nutrient-rich.

However, rainforest soils, although highly variable, share the characteristic of having mineral nutrients washed out by abundant rainfall, a process known as leaching.

As a result of leaching, most tropical rainforest soils have low to very low mineral nutrient content, which is in stark contrast to the mineral-rich soils found in grasslands.

Tropical forest soils also often contain specific types of clays that do not bind mineral ions effectively, unlike the mineral-binding clays found in temperate forest soils.

Aluminum is the dominant cation present in tropical soils, and while plants do not require this element, it is moderately toxic to a wide range of plants.

Additionally, aluminum reduces the availability of phosphorus, which is highly demanded by plants.

The high moisture and temperatures in tropical regions accelerate the growth of soil microbes that decompose organic compounds.

Consequently, tropical soils typically contain lower amounts of organic materials (humus) compared to other forest or grassland soils.

Organic compounds play a crucial role in loosening compact clay soils, retaining water, and binding mineral nutrients.

The relative scarcity of organic materials in tropical soils negatively affects plant growth.

Plant roots struggle to penetrate hard clay soils, and during dry periods, the soil fails to retain sufficient water to meet plant needs.

Due to the low concentration of dark-colored organic materials, tropical soils often exhibit red or yellow colors due to the presence of iron, aluminum, and manganese oxides.

When dry, these soils become extremely hard, as exemplified by the famous Cambodian temples of Angkor Wat, which were constructed using blocks of such rainforest soils.

Given the poor quality of these soils, one might wonder how lush tropical forests can thrive.

The answer lies in the fact that the forest's minerals are held within its living biomass, including trees, plants, and animals.

Unlike grasslands, where a significant proportion of plant biomass is underground, the biomass of tropical forests is primarily aboveground.

Dead leaves, branches, and other plant parts, as well as the waste and remains of rainforest animals, quickly decompose on the forest floor due to the abundance of decomposers such as bacteria and fungi.

The minerals released during decay are rapidly absorbed by numerous shallow, fine tree feeder roots and stored in plant tissues.

Many tropical rainforest plants, like those in other forests, form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi.

These delicate fungal hyphae spread extensively through the soil, releasing and absorbing minerals and transporting them back to the host plant in exchange for organic compounds.

Fungal hyphae can also absorb phosphorus that plant roots cannot obtain from the dilute soil solutions, and they can transfer mineral nutrients between forest plants.

Consequently, tropical rainforests typically exhibit closed nutrient systems, where minerals are efficiently transferred from one organism to another with minimal loss to the soil.

Closed nutrient systems have evolved as a response to the leaching effects of heavy tropical rainfall.

It is worth noting that nutrient systems tend to be more open in the richest tropical soils and more closed in the poorest soils.

The growth of organisms depends on the availability of nutrients, with none being more critical than nitrogen.

Although nitrogen is abundant in the Earth's atmosphere, plants cannot absorb it unless it is chemically "fixed" and combined with other elements to form nitrogen compounds.

Nitrogen-fixing bacteria play a crucial role in helping tropical rainforest plants cope with the poor soils by supplying them with the necessary nitrogen.

Many species of tropical rainforest trees belong to the legume family, which is known for its associations with nitrogen-fixing bacteria within root nodules.

Additionally, cycads, a type of tropical plant resembling a palm tree, develop specialized aboveground roots that host nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria.

By growing above the ground, these roots are exposed to sunlight, which is essential for the growth of cyanobacteria.

Nitrogen fixation by free-living bacteria in tropical soils also provides benefits.
