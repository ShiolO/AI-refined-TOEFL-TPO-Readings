Building Materials

The radical change brought by the new industrial world of the nineteenth century to architectural materials cannot be overstated.

Throughout architectural history, the same fundamental substances had been utilized.

They were sourced directly from nature and used in their natural or near-natural state, only cut, shaped, and dried into functional forms such as timbers, stone blocks, and clay bricks.

Lime mortar and Roman concrete were exceptions.

Metals, which possessed the tensile strength lacking in masonry materials, were used in minor and supplementary capacities.

Bronze, although brittle and expensive, was employed, while iron, the more structurally significant metal, was limited in availability and quality, and susceptible to rust.

Consequently, it was primarily used for tie-rods, chains, masonry clamps, and decoration.

Prior to the nineteenth century, iron's structural presence in architecture was hardly noticeable.

The Industrial Revolution changed this paradigm.

Iron materials became abundantly available, enabling them to play a much larger role in architecture.

In 1800, global iron production stood at 825,000 tons.

By 1830, it had reached 1,825,000 tons, and by 1900, it had soared to nearly 40,000,000 tons-an almost fifty-fold increase over the century.

This growth was not only in quantity but also in quality.

Iron, found plentifully in the Earth's crust as an oxide, is a material with remarkable variability.

It is not simply pure or impure but can be made hard or soft, brittle or ductile, strong or weak.

These characteristics depend on carbon content, freedom from impurities (slag), and heating and cooling treatments of the refined metal.

Traditionally, three versions existed: cast iron, wrought iron, and steel.

Cast iron is the crudest form, containing the most impurities and thus being extremely brittle.

Wrought iron, due to its low carbon content, is highly malleable (hence its name) but comparably soft.

The optimal material is steel, which incorporates a restricted amount of carbon for hardness while being free of impurities, giving it great strength.

Through tempering treatments, steel also becomes malleable.

Cast and wrought iron experienced prodigious manufacturing in the early and mid-nineteenth century due to rapid demand growth, improved transportation methods, and more efficient iron-founding techniques.

However, the mass production of steel required further technological innovations to eliminate weakening impurities and achieve precise control over carbon content.

These advancements were realized with the implementation of the Bessemer process in 1860 and the open-hearth process in 1864.

In the last third of the century, scientific iron metallurgy perfected these techniques.

A significant yet lesser-known fact is that the main form of increased steel production was technically not steel but a type of wrought iron.

It lacked a crucial property of true steel-its hardening power.

However, it differed from older forms of wrought iron because it was free from the weakening presence of slag while remaining malleable (unlike cast iron).

It was labeled as steel solely because the name carried the connotation of a high-quality and high-priced product.

Another alternative building material was concrete, consisting of an aggregate of broken stone, gravel, or other hard fragments embedded in a matrix of lime, sand, and water.

Although first used in Roman times, its modern resurgence relied on the invention of Portland cement in 1824-a substance significantly stronger, more durable, and fire-resistant than ancient lime cement.

Mass-produced concrete began to be widely used in the 1850s and 1860s, such as in the construction of the sewers of Paris.

However, even with Portland cement, the use of concrete was limited by its low tensile strength.

The solution came in the form of newly available iron and steel, whose properties complemented those of concrete.

The latter material was inexpensive and easily molded into large structural forms with high compressive strength but limited tensile strength.

On the other hand, iron and steel were costly, challenging to shape, but possessed exceptional tensile strength and were readily available in the form of long, thin bars.
