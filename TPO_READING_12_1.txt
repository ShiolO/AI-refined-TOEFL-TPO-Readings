Which Hand Did They Use?

We all know that there are more right-handed people today than left-handed people.

Can we observe the same pattern in prehistory?

Much of the evidence regarding right-hand versus left-hand dominance comes from stencils and prints discovered in rock shelters in Australia and other locations, as well as in numerous Ice Age caves in France, Spain, and Tasmania.

When a left hand is stenciled, it implies that the artist was right-handed, and vice versa.

Although the paint was often applied using the mouth, we can assume that the dominant hand played a role in the process.

Additionally, we must assume that the hands were stenciled with the palm facing downward, as a left hand stenciled with the palm facing upward could be mistaken for a right hand.

Out of the 158 stencils found in the Gargas cave in France, 136 have been identified as left hands, while only 22 have been identified as right hands, indicating a significant prevalence of right-handedness.

Cave art provides additional evidence of this phenomenon.

Most engravings, for instance, are best illuminated from the left, which aligns with the work of right-handed artists who typically prefer the light source to be on the left side to avoid casting shadows from their hands onto the tip of the engraving tool or brush.

In the few instances where an Ice Age figure is depicted holding something, it is mostly, although not always, in the right hand.

Clues to right-handedness can also be found through other methods.

Right-handed individuals tend to have longer, stronger, and more muscular bones on their right side.

As far back as 1911, Marcellin Boule noted that the Neanderthal skeleton from La Chapelle-aux-Saints had a noticeably stronger right upper arm bone compared to the left.

Similar observations have been made on other Neanderthal skeletons such as La Ferrassie I and Neanderthal itself.

Fractures and cut marks also serve as sources of evidence.

Right-handed soldiers tend to sustain injuries on their left side.

The skeleton of a 40- or 50-year-old Nabatean warrior, buried 2,000 years ago in the Negev Desert, Israel, exhibited multiple healed fractures on the skull, left arm, and ribs.

Tools themselves can reveal information as well.

Long-handled Neolithic spoons made of yew wood, dating back to 3000 B.C., have been preserved in Alpine villages.

The signs of wear on the left side of these spoons indicate that their users were right-handed.

The late Ice Age rope discovered in the French cave of Lascaux consists of fibers spiraling to the right, suggesting that it was twisted by a right-handed individual.

Occasionally, it is possible to determine whether stone tools were used in the right or left hand, allowing us to trace this feature back in time.

In stone toolmaking experiments, Nick Toth, a right-hander, held the core (the stone that would become the tool) in his left hand and the hammer stone in his right.

As the tool was crafted, the core was rotated clockwise, resulting in flakes being removed in sequence, with a small crescent of cortex (the outer surface of the core) on the side.

Toth's knapping process produced 56 percent of flakes with cortex on the right side and 44 percent with cortex on the left side.

A left-handed toolmaker would produce the opposite pattern.

Toth applied these criteria to pebble tools from several early sites (predating 1.5 million years) at Koobi Fora, Kenya, most likely made by Homo habilis.

He found that at seven sites, 57 percent of the flakes were right-oriented, while 43 percent were left-oriented, a pattern nearly identical to what is observed today.

Approximately 90 percent of modern humans are right-handed, making us the only mammal with a preference for one hand.

The part of the brain responsible for fine control and movement is located in the left cerebral hemisphere.

The aforementioned findings suggest that the human brain had already developed structural and functional asymmetry shortly after 2 million years ago.

Marcellin Boule noted that among Neanderthals from 70,000 to 35,000 years ago, the individual from La Chapelle-aux-Saints had a slightly larger left hemisphere, and the same was observed in the brains of specimens from Neanderthal, Gibraltar, and La Quina.
